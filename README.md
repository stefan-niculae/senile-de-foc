### Senile de Foc
###### (Fire Tracks)

What started as a project for the Software Engineering class quickly turned into a passion project.
Senile de Foc is a topdown tank deathmatch game that can be played by up to 4 players online.

Each tank has a primary weapon (missiles or bullets, optionally - they can be bouncy) and a secondary weapon (electricity blast, pushing blast, damaging explosion or poison damage over time).
Different tanks cater to different playstyles - fast and sneaky, slow but steady or a balance between.
I focused on gameplay (easy controls, rewarding kills, unfrustrating deaths) as well as great UX (one example is that the login form expands into the register form on the same screen when a new account is entered - this way, there is no need to enter account & desire password twice and the clunkyness is eliminated).

The server and client were written in Unity, networking done in native UnityNetwork as well.
Game art, UI elements, particles, sound effects and music are downloaded from the community.
