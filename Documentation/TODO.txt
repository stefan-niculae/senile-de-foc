BALANCING
attribute tweaking

SOUNDS
volume tweaking
extra ones (tank, wall, barrel hit; loading, match end music)

TERRAIN
undestroyable placement (on mud and sand)

FLOW
infinite loading graphic: white background

MATCH SETUP
Lobby: time limit, kill limit
server knows when the time expired/kill limit reached, itâ€™s not up to the clients to send this info (so it can accept new connections)



GAME HELP
scoreboard popups
	tank preview -> primary (bouncy?) + secondary


BUGS
Sometimes saved username is not shown (shows blank, on typing start, it appears)


FUTURE VERSIONS
let users make their own gamerooms (no authorative server, switch to unity 5.1 networking)
scalable tank, projectile mass, explosion particle size
resave all ui elements as psds
set preferred resolution to 1080p
make trailer
local (splitscreen) multiplayer
gamepad support
camera shake (when being hit?)
