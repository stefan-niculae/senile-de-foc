BALANCING
attribute tweaking

SOUNDS
volume tweaking
extra ones (tank, wall, barrel hit; loading, match end music)

FLOW
message for connection not allowed because game is running


NEW FEATURES
Help panel: what barrels do, what the icons mean (kdabr), trees, walls, border, tank abilities, bounce, respawn point
Other loading graphic for when waiting for opponents

Lobby: time limit, kill limit
server knows when the time expired/kill limit reached, itâ€™s not up to the clients to send this info (so it can accept new connections)
If connected players list is empty, switch server to splash state


BUGS
Kd panel deaths don't update
Death doesn't happen
Login saved username sometimes is blank


FUTURE VERSIONS
let users make their own gamerooms (no authorative server, switch to unity 5.1 networking)
scalable tank, projectile mass, explosion particle size
resave all ui elements as psds
set preferred resolution to 1080p
make trailer
local (splitscreen) multiplayer
gamepad support
camera shake (when being hit?)
